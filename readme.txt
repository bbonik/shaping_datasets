SHAPING DATASETS: OPTIMAL DATA SELECTION FOR SPECIFIC TARGET DISTRIBUTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following MATLAB scripts demonstrate the results of the proposed technique and show how to run the
MILP optimization code. Also, there are scripts to replicate the results of the paper. 



> "SHAPE.m" is the main function that shapes the dataset

> "test_shaping_Gallagher.m" and "test_shaping_Helen.m" are scripts that apply the technique to 2 
  different datasets.

> "GHALLAGHER.mat" and "HELEN.mat", contain the filenames and attributes extracted for these 2 datasets. 
  No actual images are included, due to copyright issues.

If you want the actual images of the datasets, you may find them from the following links:
Gallagher dataset: http://chenlab.ece.cornell.edu/people/Andy/GallagherDataset.html
Helen dataset: http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~vuongle2/helen/

> "test_shaping_random.m" is a script that demonstrates the technique in randomly generated data points,
  from different initial distributions.

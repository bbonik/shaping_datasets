SHAPING DATASETS: OPTIMAL DATA SELECTION FOR SPECIFIC TARGET DISTRIBUTIONS



This MATLAB code replicates the results of the paper and demonstates how to run the MILP optimization code. 


SHAPE.m is the main function that shapes the dataset

SHAPE_GHALLAGHER.m and SHAPE_HELEN.m are scripts that apply the technique to 2 different datasets.
GHALLAGHER.mat and HELEN.mat, contain the filenames and attributes extracted for these 2 datasets. No actual images are included, due to copyright issues.

If you want the actual images of the datasets, you may find them from the following links:
Gallagher dataset: http://chenlab.ece.cornell.edu/people/Andy/GallagherDataset.html
Helen dataset: http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~vuongle2/helen/
